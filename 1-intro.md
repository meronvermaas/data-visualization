# Introduction

When using the [Data Visualization Handbook](resources/DataVizHandbook_IV.pdf) by Iraklis Vretzakis, would't it be great if you can also produce the graphs that are described?

That's what inspired us to create this coding turotial. Here, you'll be able to find coding examples in both R and python for 7 of the most commonly used plots in scientific research. We will also go over their characteristics and individual strengths, providing a practical guide that complements the Data Visualization Handbook to help you choose the graph that best represents your data. 

For this tutorial, we will be using two different datasets obtained from Neuroscience projects. You can find a detailed description of each dataset in the Dataset 1 and Dataset two sections. 

Let's code!
