# Different data, different graphs!

Methamphetamine (METH) is a stimulant amphetamine drug that is extremely addictive. Alot of people are treated for METH use disorder relapse. This study by (Miao et al., 2023)[https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-023-05355-3] looks at the epigenetic and transcriptomic changes induced in a few rat brain regions and they find a strong molecular response of the neurotoxic METH in all the regions, although different regions respond differently. The study also supports previous research indicating complicated epigenetic remodeling events at different levels induced by METH exposure, rather than differentially expressed genes correlating directly to chromatic accessibility changes on the promoter region. 

We used the gene expression dataset to plot a heatmap, scatterplot and lineplot. To be able to make it concise for this practice we shortened the (original dataset)[https://figshare.com/projects/Methamphetamine-induced_region-specific_transcriptomic_and_epigenetic_changes_in_the_brain_of_male_rats/177378] to keep only about 155 genes. 

Now, let's visualize the data!
